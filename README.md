# Awair air quality monitor

This full stack project aims to provide an alternative to the unreliable official app and server to monitor and visualize home air quality using an Awair IoT device.

The server was built using Django and SQLite which collects the data from a local computer through a LAN API.

The web front-end and android app retrieve the data from the server and display it.
